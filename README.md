**THINGS TO DO:**

- come up with algorithm for generating voltorbs, try to have it be dynamic based off of original rules.
- add typewriter effect to dialogue (save for later)
- add win state at end of game.
- make board size buttons prettier
- add sound effects?
- on round end, transfer round points to total points.

**COMPLETE**

- have reset button clear round score.
- extra transition for dialogue box after round is over, have it be generic for both possible states.
