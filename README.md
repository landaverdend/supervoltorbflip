**THINGS TO DO:**

- add typewriter effect to dialogue (save for later)
- add sound effects?
- fix bug with animations at the end of the round and fast clicking
- on menu exit, default back to all of the options.
- fix bug where an extra one is added to total score at end of round.
- on click/key press have the animation do a little particle explosion?

  **COMPLETE**

- on round end, transfer round points to total points.
- make board size buttons prettier
- have reset button clear round score.
- extra transition for dialogue box after round is over, have it be generic for both possible states.
